    <h2>Hey there! I'm a jsPanel !</h2>

    <p>While I was writing a backend for my brother's website <a href="http://derpanoramafotograf.com/" title="">derpanoramafotograf.com</a> ,
        I was looking for a jQuery plugin that gives me the option to accommodate various kinds of content in customizable panels.
        As I could not find what I was looking for, I finally decided to write a plugin myself. And here is the result.</p>
    <p>Size, position and a bunch of other options are freely configurable. You can add a toolbar and using the jQuery-UI features
        the jsPanels are draggable and resizable, and are customizable by changing the css styles. The jsPanels can be minimized,
        maximized or restored to their original size and position.</p>
    <p>The contents of the jsPanels can be inserted in several ways. Even childpanels can be positioned within a
        parentpanel.</p>
    <p>For my purposes, the plugin works very well. And maybe it's useful to others who need a similar plugin.</p>

    <p style="font-weight: bold;">And this is the code that generated this example:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
$( '#content' ).jsPanel({
    size: {
        width: 600,
        height: 'auto'
    },
    position: {
        top: 50,
        left: 'center'
    },
    ajax: {
        url: 'files/welcomepanel.html'
    }
});
</pre>

</div>

<script>
    prettyPrint();
</script>
